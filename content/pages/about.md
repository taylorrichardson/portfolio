I'm Taylor. A young professional working out of Ottawa, Ontario. I'm an Economics graduate from Carleton University with a post-graduate certificate in Data Analytics from Durham College. My hobbies include mechanical keyboards, Oldschool Runescape, and hockey.

Currently I work at the [AI/Hub](https://durhamcollege.ca/about/office-of-research-services-innovation-and-entrepreneurship-orsie/the-ai-hub) as a Principal Investigator, leading applied research projects in conjuncture with local industry partners to implement AI into their businesses. I started at the AI/Hub as a student researcher and have been on almost a dozen projects to date, many of which are detailed in my projects page.

I am also a Web Developer at [Health Espresso](https://healthespresso.com/), a remote patient monitoring application that allows doctors and patients to achieve greater transparency and communication of critical personal information. I have been involved in both the development of both mobile applications (first in NativeScript, then in Flutter), as well as being the primary developer for the web portal (written in React).

 I have also done some data analytics consulting work, specifically in the field of wearable technology, including developing tools to monitor data, create reports and perform advanced analysis.

In my spare time, I volunteer as a developer at [Shelter Movers](http://sheltermovers.com/), an incredible organization that helps individuals at risk of domestic violence move out of their home by providing moving supplies, vehicles and volunteers free of cost. I have been involved in the general improvement, redesign and management of their website (Wordpress).
