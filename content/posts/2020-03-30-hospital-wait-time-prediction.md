  Partnering with Lakeridge Health, the team at the AI/Hub was able to produce a
  machine learning model that is able to predict patient wait times.

A major driver of frustration, anxiety and poor patient experience in an Emergency Department (ED) is waiting for the physician and nursing team to be available. More efficient communication on wait times would enable patients and families to cope with waiting, in ways such as going outside, moving to the cafeteria, or making a decision to seek alternative healthcare access (e.g., go to an urgent care clinic the next day). The utilization of Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions, more specifically Machine Learning, has shown promise to synthesize vast amounts of independent variables to predict utilization and output data.

In this successful project, AI was used to predict individual patient wait times based on historical and ongoing data, forming the basis of an AI infused recommender system. Completed by a team of student researchers including myself. This project utilized machine learning deploy within a [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) server in order to move from concept to prototype. To my knowledge, there are no known AI applications being utilized to predict individual ED wait times; instead aggregate outputs are more common (e.g. St. Mary's General and Alberta Health Services).

A collaboration between the Durham College AI Hub and Lakeridge Health has enabled this applied research project to be an initial proof of concept. The primary goal of the study was to showcase the simulated effects of applying AI with a focus on the accuracy and precision of the model.
