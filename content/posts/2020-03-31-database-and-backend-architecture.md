  In my first project as a Principal Investigator, we teamed up with a local
  business in order to create a backend database and API in order to help
  facilitate the launch of a localized social media platform.

The business collaborated with Durham College's AI/Hub to create a strong database and server architecture in order to implement a chatbot in a future project. The project was co-led by principal investigator, Taylor Richardson. This will allow users to engage and interact with social activities in their city. The goal of this project was to create a database and server architecture, which will be robust and easily compatible with the chatbot as well as the rest of their social networking platform. Research of the development and implementation of a database and server that is AI compatible, scalable, and regionalized was done. There was a need to determine an effective schema and database architecture for the social media platform and the chatbot. Lastly, the students deployed an API to interface with database and created an API to update and retrieve information from the database.
