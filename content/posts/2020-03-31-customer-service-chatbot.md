A local call center has worked with Durham College's AI/Hub team to develop a chatbot that utilizes NLP (Natural Language Processing) backend Chatbot to improve users' experience and support engagement with users on their website. Completed by a team of student researchers including myself.

The bot can answer routine queries with intelligence, and therefore bringing down the volume of emails and calls that are otherwise left for the support staff. The system aims to not only boost the user experience, but also to reduce the response time for user queries. 



The bot is not intended to replace call centre agents but instead to assist the existing agents with specializing in more unique topics - the bot has been branded and skinned to CCG's brand and requirements. Currently CCG uses an interface called Gorgias that connects to a live agent. Our team explored how best we can connect into this platform through a REST API. The project focused strictly on text-based inputs.
